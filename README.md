- **Access**: Instant, no database calls
- **Scope**: Current session only

### **MTM (Medium-Term Memory)**
- **Purpose**: Complete conversation history and session management
- **Storage**: SQLite database with full conversation sessions
- **Access**: All conversations across all communication modes (Telegram, Web UI, etc.)
- **Scope**: Permanent storage of every line of dialogue
- **Features**: 
  - Session summarization after completion
  - Cross-platform conversation linking
  - Readable through ADK web interface

### **LTM (Long-Term Memory)**
- **Purpose**: Semantic knowledge and contextual recall
- **Storage**: Vector database (JSON files in `instance/vector_db/`) for semantic search
- **Access**: Intelligent retrieval based on conversation relevance
- **Scope**: Key facts, preferences, relationships, and contextual knowledge
- **Features**:
  - Automatic fact extraction and storage
  - Context-aware retrieval system
  - Personal information learning

### **Memory Flow**
1. **STM**: Immediate context for current conversation
2. **MTM**: Permanent storage of all conversations across all platforms
3. **LTM**: Intelligent context building based on conversation relevance

## üìà Roadmap

**Overall Goal:** To build a personal AI agent that understands context, anticipates needs, and acts proactively across various domains, leveraging ADK's capabilities and external integrations.

---

**Phase 1: Core Conversational Intelligence & Essential Real-World Awareness**
*   **Goal:** Make Amy a more capable and context-aware text-based assistant.
*   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Custom Tool: Current Local Time:**
        *   Implement a Python function to get the current time and convert it to a specified timezone.
        *   Integrate this as an ADK tool for Amy.
        *   Update Amy's instructions to use this tool when asked about time.
    2.  **Custom Tool: Current Weather:**
        *   Obtain an API key for a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
        *   Implement a Python function to fetch weather data for a given location.
        *   Integrate this as an ADK tool for Amy.
        *   Update Amy's instructions to use this tool when asked about weather.
    3.  **Improved Error Handling & User Feedback:**
        *   Enhance Amy's responses when she encounters limitations or errors (e.g., "I can't find the weather for that location," or "I don't have access to that information yet").

---

**Phase 2: Real-time Voice & Robust Long-Term Memory**
*   **Goal:** Enable natural voice interaction and establish a scalable LTM system.
*   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Gemini Live API Integration (Voice Input/Output):**
        *   **Critical External Dependency:** Gain access to a Gemini Live API model (e.g., `gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog`). This will likely require contacting Google Cloud support or AI Studio support.
        *   Update Amy's `model` parameter to use the Live API model.
        *   Test real-time voice interaction via `adk web`.
    2.  **Advanced Long-Term Memory (LTM) - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
        *   **Option A (Recommended): Vertex AI RAG:**
            *   Set up a Google Cloud Project and enable Vertex AI API.
            *   Create a Vertex AI RAG Corpus.
            *   Configure `VertexAiRagMemoryService` in Amy's ADK setup.
            *   Develop tools for Amy to "ingest" (store) and "retrieve" (search) information from the RAG corpus.
        *   **Option B (Alternative): Local Vector Database:**
            *   Choose and set up a local vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS).
            *   Integrate an embedding model (e.g., from `sentence-transformers`).
            *   Develop custom tools for Amy to store and retrieve information from this local vector database.
    3.  **Basic Proactivity - Time-Based Reminders:**
        *   Implement a tool for Amy to set and trigger simple time-based reminders (e.g., "Remind me to call John at 3 PM"). This would involve storing reminders in the database and a background process to check and trigger them.

---

**Phase 3: Deeper Integration & Contextual Proactivity**
*   **Goal:** Amy starts integrating with personal services and anticipating needs based on broader context.
*   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Calendar Integration:**
        *   Implement tools to read and potentially write events to your calendar (e.g., Google Calendar API).
        *   Update Amy's instructions to manage your schedule.
    2.  **Task Management Integration:**
        *   Implement tools to interact with a task management system (e.g., Google Tasks, Todoist API).
        *   Enable Amy to create, update, and query tasks.
    3.  **Contextual Triggers (Basic):**
        *   Develop logic for Amy to proactively offer help based on simple contextual cues (e.g., time of day, upcoming calendar events).
        *   *Example:* "It's 5 PM, would you like me to summarize your day's tasks?"
    4.  **User Preferences (LTM Extension):**
        *   Expand the LTM to explicitly store and retrieve user preferences (e.g., preferred coffee, communication style, common contacts).

---

**Phase 4: Multimodal Perception & Advanced Proactivity**
*   **Goal:** Amy becomes truly multimodal and highly anticipatory, acting as a digital twin.
*   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Vision Integration:**
        *   Integrate with ADK's video streaming capabilities (requires Live API model with vision).
        *   Develop tools for Amy to "see" and describe her surroundings or analyze visual input.
    2.  **Advanced Proactivity (Predictive):**
        *   Implement more sophisticated anticipation based on complex patterns, external data feeds, and predictive analytics.
        *   *Example:* "Based on your calendar and traffic, you should leave in 10 minutes to make your meeting on time. I've already sent directions to your car."
    3.  **Emotional Intelligence (Basic):**
        *   Integrate sentiment analysis or tone detection (from voice/text input) to allow Amy to adapt her communication style.
    4.  **Complex Workflow Orchestration:**
        *   Utilize ADK's `WorkflowAgent` and `ParallelAgent` to manage multi-step, complex tasks autonomously.
